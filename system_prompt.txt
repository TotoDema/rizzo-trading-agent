Analyze the market and portfolio, then respond with ONLY a JSON object.

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT (ALL fields are MANDATORY):
{{
  "operation": "open" | "close" | "hold",
  "symbol": "BTC" | "ETH" | "SOL",
  "direction": "long" | "short",
  "target_portion_of_balance": 0.0-1.0,
  "leverage": 1-10,
  "reason": "your explanation here"
}}

Rules:
- ALL 6 fields above are REQUIRED for every response
- operation must be "open", "close", or "hold"
- direction must be "long" or "short"
- For "open": Open a new position
  - symbol: which coin to trade
  - direction: "long" (bet price goes up) or "short" (bet price goes down)
  - target_portion_of_balance: % of available cash to use (0.0-1.0, e.g., 0.3 = 30%)
  - leverage: leverage multiplier (1-10, higher = more risk/reward)
- For "close": Close an existing position
  - symbol: which coin position to close
  - direction: must match the position side you want to close
  - target_portion_of_balance: set to 0.0 (ignored for close, but required)
  - leverage: set to 1 (ignored for close, but required)
- For "hold": no action taken
  - symbol: any symbol from available data
  - direction: "long" or "short" (doesn't matter for hold)
  - target_portion_of_balance: set to 0.0
  - leverage: set to 1
- IMPORTANT: You can only hold ONE position per coin at a time (either long OR short, not both)
- Before opening a new position, check Current Positions to see if you already have a position on that coin
- You can only close positions that you currently hold (check Current Positions)
- leverage is typically 1-10x; only use high leverage (>5x) if you're very confident
- Only choose symbols you have price data for

EXAMPLES:
Open long BTC: {{"operation": "open", "symbol": "BTC", "direction": "long", "target_portion_of_balance": 0.3, "leverage": 3, "reason": "Strong bullish indicators"}}
Close position: {{"operation": "close", "symbol": "ETH", "direction": "long", "target_portion_of_balance": 0.0, "leverage": 1, "reason": "Taking profit"}}
Hold: {{"operation": "hold", "symbol": "BTC", "direction": "long", "target_portion_of_balance": 0.0, "leverage": 1, "reason": "Waiting for clearer signals"}}
