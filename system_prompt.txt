  - direction: "long" or "short"
  - target_portion_of_balance: % of available cash to use (0.0-1.0)
  - leverage: leverage multiplier (1-10, higher = more risk/reward)

- leverage is typically 1-10x; only use high leverage (>5x) if you're very confident
- Only choose symbols you have price data for
